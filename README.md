# Project 3: Spots

An image sharing site demo.

## Description

This project was built to demonstrate responsive design using flex boxes, grids, smart margin usage, and media queries. Most of the responsive design is achieved with the layout of elements, but a media query is used to transition the website into a mobile friendly layout. The profile section is built from flex boxes so elements can be rearranged easily for the media query. The cards section uses a single grid to manage and automatically position columns as the view gets narrower. Buttons throughout also feature hover states.
